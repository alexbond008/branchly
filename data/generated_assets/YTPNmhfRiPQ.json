  "linkedin_post": "Just finished watching a fantastic breakdown of Electrical Engineering vs Computer Science by a recent grad who's lived both paths. Key takeaway: EE offers incredible flexibility\u2014you can pivot to software, physics, renewable energy, or FPGAs. CS is more specialized, requiring stronger commitment to coding from day one.\n\nIf you're undecided about your engineering path, EE gives you more optionality. Both degrees develop exceptional problem-solving skills, but the career trajectories diverge significantly. The skills you build\u2014data handling, systems thinking, coding\u2014are universally valuable, but the foundation matters.\n\nChoosing between them? Know yourself first.",
  "twitter_post": "EE vs CS: EE gives flexibility across physics, software, renewable energy & FPGAs. CS is narrower but specialized. Both build amazing skills\u2014just pick based on your interests in coding & hardware. \ud83d\udd0c\ud83d\udcbb"
