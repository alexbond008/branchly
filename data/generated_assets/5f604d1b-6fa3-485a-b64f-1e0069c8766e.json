  "linkedin_post": "Just finished a deep dive comparing Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degrees. After completing an EE degree with internships in both hardware and software, here's what I wish I knew earlier:\n\nBoth degrees cover fundamentals like math, programming, and digital systems. But EE gives you flexibility across physics, power systems, renewable energy, and software\u2014while CS is more specialized and coding-focused.\n\nChoosing between them? If you're unsure about your path, EE offers more career pivots. If you're committed to software engineering, go straight CS. Either way, you'll develop incredible problem-solving skills.",
