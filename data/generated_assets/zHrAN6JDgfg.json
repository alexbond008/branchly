  "description": "A first-time hackathon experience following a software engineer and his team as they build Journey Radar, an app that uses graph algorithms to predict commute times and flag traffic incidents on public transport routes. Despite technical challenges and only 5 hours of sleep, the team powers through a 24-hour coding marathon to submit their project.",

Despite backend challenges and only 5 hours of sleep, we shipped a working prototype in 24 hours.\n\nThe experience taught me more about teamwork, problem-solving under pressure, and shipping products than months of solo coding. While we didn't make the finals, the journey itself was the victory\u2014I feel like a winner.\n\nThinking of attending your first hackathon? Do it. You'll surprise yourself with what you can build.",
